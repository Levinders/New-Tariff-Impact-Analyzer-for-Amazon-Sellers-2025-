# New Tariff Impact Analyzer for Amazon Sellers (2025)

![Project Banner](images/project_banner.png)

# Project Motivation & Overview
While scrolling through LinkedIn, I came across a post from Chad Rubin of Profasee, a well known voice in the Amazon sellers' community. He had just shared a spreadsheet tool he built — a straightforward but helpful Tariff Impact Analyzer designed to help Amazon sellers understand how the new and changing tariffs of 2025 were affecting their margins.

As someone who’s interest is about making data easier to understand, I was immediately drawn in. The workbook was truly business helpful and functional, but it presented its results mainly through rows of spreadsheet. I saw an opportunity to give the numbers flesh and improve usability.

That same day, Chad shared his workbook and I began working on it — not to change the logic or calculations, but to elevate the user experience through visuals. I introduced charts and dashboards that translated the outputs into clear narrative visuals. The goal was to make it easier for Amazon sellers using the analyzer to not only compute and see the impact of tariffs, but to see it — instantly and intuitively.

This project became a small but meaningful example of how data visualization can transform the way business owners interpret and act on information.
